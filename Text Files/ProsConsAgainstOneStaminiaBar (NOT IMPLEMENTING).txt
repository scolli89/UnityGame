Issue:Combining Ammunition as part of the dash-shield system

Pros:

player:
-easier to understand. Only one bar that affects everything. Very stamina like. 
	- easier to learn for new players
- less decisisoin fatigue: There is no "Which bar do i use?"

Programmer:
- easier to code. Only bound checking one variable. 
- less ui gameobjects to build. 
- less clutter game screen ( For more players) 

Cons:

- becomes reliant on one stat. : Staminia recharge. 
 	- Everything will revolve around one mechanic. (Simplicity) 
- may encourage more campy behaviour from players if recharges on its own

- defeats the point of free for all gameplay. 

What ifs: 
	
One V One:
- Healer: AURA : would(SHOULD) not be able to recharge themself. 
	- beacuse there would be no need to rehcarge if they were full and
	- if they were low, they would either be able to abuse it or would not be able to heal themselves at all. (NO point or INFINITE USE) 
- HEALER: SHOOTER : cannot shoot themselves (Unless they dash into it, but that is breaking the game (NO point or INFINITE USE) 
- HEALER: RESSURECT - IF you ran out of energy you cannot ressurect yourself. 
- HEALER: Repairs walls - WHOSE WALLS? 

- BUILDER: 

One + AI V One + AI

















Issue: Combining Dash and shield; seperate ammunition.


GAME MODE IDEAS:
- We tied stamina recharge to map environemnts. :KING OF THE HILL
		- three types of zones.
			- red: most common : no recharge.
			- blue: uncommon : moderate recharge
			- green: Rare(1 or 2) : fast recharge
