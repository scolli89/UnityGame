Things we talked about;
Active skills
	> abilities
	> defensive
	> stratigic
	> offensive
	> Support
	> World manipulation (Bridge building) 
Passive skills:
	> what would these be?



Dodge Skills: (roll, parry, duck)
	> iframes (pretty sure angry arrows does not have iframes)
	> speed
	> distance
	> attacks have active frames
	>
Movement speed
	> walk speed
	> run ?
	> Dodge speed
	
Projectile
	> Size
	> Speed
	> Strength/damage
	> Collision ability (What happens when two projectiles meet?)
Health
	> Size/ hp points
	> 


What is a class? 
	-> just a active skill?
	-> are they all things
	-> 
	-> How much control do we let the player have when creating a class? All/ or none
	-> balancing is a whole issue. 
	








class type ideas:
base guy:
	projectile:
	active:
	passive:
	dodge:

healer:
	active: heal other players
	passive:
	modifiers: move slower,
archer:
	active: triple shot
	passive:
	modifiers: move faster, faster shot. regular health
wall builder: 
	active: build temparary barrior for defensive
	passive: 
	modifiers: higher health
bridge builder:
	active:build bridges over impassable objects(rivers, ravines)
	passive:

landminer:
	active: place land mines
	secondary: disable landmines (add to inventory?)
	passive:

trap man:
	active: place trap

necromancer:
	active: revive player. 
	passive: 
Rogue:
	active: stealth/slow movement
	active: smoke bomb, lose focus. 
	passive: cannot be hit by teammates arrows. 



Minimum viable product.
-> One class.
-> No abilities/ Angry arrows like build. 
-> Get the arrows, the movement. 
-> Open space. 
-> getting the rolls going. (Without iframes) 
-> Assets, need basic hero, arrow, bow, ground sprites.
