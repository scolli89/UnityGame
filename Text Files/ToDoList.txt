TODO List! 
BUGS / ISSUES
	> ABLE TO CLIP THROUGH BRIDGE AND walk on water. 
	> BUILDERS NEED TO BE ABLE SHOOT THROUGH THEIR OWN WALLS.

What do we need to be "Done" and happy by next week? 
	> Clean up player UI:
		> No ammo bar, No health bar
		> Just battery
	> Scoreboard
		> After game -> must
		> W: During game. 
	> Slow down fire rate. 
	> Fix the existing classes
	> Add atleast 4 classes that we kind of like:
		> Turret -> Hardest part would be targeting only enemies-> Only game types are freeforall, just don't target the placer
		> Teleporter -> Place the two parts? Or place one then press b again to teleport? destroyable? 
		> Bubble shield -> no bullets move in, no bullets move out. 
			> Refraction shield ? -> bullets enter but get refracted at a strange angle, Bullets exit but get refracted too
				> or bullets in refracted, bullets out not refracted : encourages use by a player. 
		> will come back to this
		> considering using fire types instead of powers	
	> Fix when you are right up against a wall, shooting left or right, you shoot right into a wall.
	> Fix When you are right up against a builder wall, able to shoot over/through it.
	> We need at least 2 more PVP levels. Not counting the current Arena 1. So

>> Class Ideas
>> Character creation : 
		> 1 class
		> 1 Class mod
		> 1 passive
		> 1 fire style

		Class : Healer 
		Base Active : Heal close range players : specific mechanic? place a tile and the tile heals, or make an aura around the healer. 
		Mod 1: allow to heal from a distance by shooting : is really easy to do. :: Bounce off of walls. 
		Mod 2:heal yourself over time
		Mod 3:reserruct (yourself or someone else ?)
		XXXXXXX mod 4: heal player walls. 

		Class : Builder
		Base Active : Build temporary barrior
		Mod 1: builder can build from (longer away or a bigger wall)
		Mod : Relective wall. 
		mod : make bridges over inaccessable areas. 
		Mod 2: one way wall,
		Mod 3: bubble shield
		Mod 4: Friendly Drone? 

		Class : Shockwave  
		Base Active : Shockwave: who pushes people away with a shock wave or whatever. 
		Mod 1: shockwave bigger

		Mod 2: Clone? 
		
		Mod X: Tether a player to a location. 
		
		Mod X+1: Portal placement? Place entry and exit locations. 
		Mod x+2: 

		Unsorted:
		1: Cancels/ drains other peoples abilities/ energy
		2: mine to imobalize -> Why would you pick this over a regular mine? longer, wider explosive range? 
		3: shot to immobalize.

		Passives:
		1: take more hits/ more shields / more health
		2: Movement Speed increase
		3: longer roll/ invicible roll/ teleport roll(teleport out of the map and die? ) / it is better, but you don't add an extra button to it. 
		4: Able to see NPC stats. / Makes all players able to see others stats/ health/ power level / gun type ?
		5: Power/ ammo recharges over time, but it starts very low or zero. 
		6: Shields recharge over time, but start very low. 
		7: Kills recharge powers

		Fire Styles:
		1: basic - decent fire rate moderate damage.
		2: Charged - Slower to shoot , deals more damage.
		3: forked - splits along the way.
		4: erasing shot - over powers other lasers, really slow.
		5: Corner turning shots - travels straight, then turns either by player or route 
		6:  remote control bomb



>> options to controll/balance class ability:
	> cool down timer, different for each in terms of balancing
		> limited ammo to encourage movement
		> ammo/power up located around map
			> randomly
			> calculated as furthest away from players
			> predetermined location under timer

	> charges on abilities : NOT take a passive abilities to give more uses to your class ability at the start of the game. 
		> more powerful abilities use more charges
		> charges are dropped at different points on the map
			> randomly
			> calculated as furthest away from players
			> predetermined location under timer







TO DONE! LIST

	>> have player UI elements ( health (which we are possibly thinking changing to shields and 1 health) and ammo.) toggle visable with a button push. 
		>>> shield displays/ shield numbers
		>>> number of power up charges. 

	>> Make the theme a space scifi with lasers and stuff
